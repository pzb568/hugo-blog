&emsp;&emsp; In Germany, they first came for the Communists,
&emsp;&emsp; and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist.
&emsp;&emsp; Then they came for the Jews,
&emsp;&emsp; and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.
&emsp;&emsp; Then they came for the trade unionists,
&emsp;&emsp;  and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist.
&emsp;&emsp; Then they came for the Catholics,
and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant.
&emsp;&emsp;  Then they came for me，
but by that time， there was no one left to speak up.
&emsp;&emsp; by Rev. Martin Niemoller, 1945

&emsp;&emsp; 在德国，起初他们追杀共产主义者，我没有说话———因为我不是共产主义者；
&emsp;&emsp; 接着他们追杀犹太人，我没有说话———因为我不是犹太人；
&emsp;&emsp; 后来他们追杀工会成员，我没有说话———因为我不是工会成员；
&emsp;&emsp; 此后他们追杀天主教徒，我没有说话———因为我是新教教徒；
&emsp;&emsp; 最后他们奔我而来，却再也没有人站出来为我说话了。
